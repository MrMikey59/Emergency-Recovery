# Malware Prevention
(OK, Really Just a Minimization of Attack Surfaces)

1. **Run an Antivirus**. An attack that tries to install malware on your computer may find the malware installation foiled by the antivirus.
2. **Disable or uninstall plug-ins** you don’t frequently use. Update those you do use.
    -	Immediately disable JAVA, Flash, Silverlight and ShockWave!
3. **Update often used software** as soon as possible. Updating your software regularly won’t protect you against zero-days, but it will ensure you have the x as soon as possible after it’s released.
4. **Avoid vulnerable software and  having unnecessary server software.** This will significantly reduce your attack surface.
5. [**Block Ads**](Block%20Ads).  
6. [**Harden your Router**](Harden%20your%20Router).  

## Block Ads
| System | Method|  
| --- | --- |
| **Android** |Open your app drawer and launch the Google Setting app. Tap “Ads” under Services and enable the “Opt out of interest-based ads” option. You can also reset your advertising ID from here by tapping “Reset advertising ID”. |  
| **Windows 10** |In the Settings app. Open the Start menu, click Settings, and select the Privacy category. At the top of the General pane, you’ll see a “Let apps use my advertising ID for experiences across apps (turning this o will reset your ID)” option. Disable this setting to disable those personalized ads. To reset your ID, just disable the setting and reenable it.|  

## Harden your Router
You can certainly harden your router against these attacks — somewhat. If the router has security holes the manufacturer hasn’t patched, you can’t completely secure it.
      - Install Firmware Updates: Ensure the latest firmware for your router is installed. Enable automatic firmware updates if the router offers it — unfortunately, most routers don’t. This at least ensures you’re protected from any aws that have been patched.
- **Disable Remote Access**: Disable remote access to the router’s web-based administration pages.
- **Change the Admin Password**: Change the password to the router’s web-based administration interface so attackers can’t just get in with the default one.
- **Turn Off UPnP**: UPnP has been particularly vulnerable. Even if UPnP isn’t vulnerable on your router, a piece of malware running somewhere inside your local network can use UPnP to change your DNS server. That’s just how UPnP works — it trusts all requests coming from within your local network.  

**DNSSEC** is supposed to provide additional security, but it’s no panacea here. In the real world, every client operating system just trusts the configured DNS server. The malicious DNS server could claim a DNS record has no DNSSEC information, or that it does have DNSSEC information and the IP address being passed along is the real one.
