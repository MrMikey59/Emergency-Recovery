# Malware

| Malware | Description |  
| --- | --- |  
| Malvertising|malware that uses third-party ad networks to embed attacks in legitimate websites, is becoming increasingly popular. [use Adblock to reduce your risk] |  
| Zero-Day Vulnerability Attack|any malware attack that exploits a newly found software vulnerability (Day 0 is discovery day) and before an update is applied to the software; these happen when the bad guys get ahead of the good guys, so developers have had zero days to deal with the problem before it’s already being exploited in the wild |  
| Drive-By Attack|an attack where just visiting a web page with malicious code on it would allow the attacker to compromise and infect your system |  

Malware often infects the boot sector, and after removing the virus from the boot sector, the computer might no longer boot. The fixboot command repairs the boot sector, and the fixmbr command repairs the MBR. Both are available in the Windows XP recovery console. Windows Vista and Windows 7 have similar commands: bootrec /fixboot and bootrec /fixmbr.
Malicious code (sometimes called malware) is a type of software designed to take over or damage a computer user's operating system, without the user's knowledge or approval. It can be very difficult to remove and very damaging. Common malware examples are listed in the following table:
There are two categories of malware: benign and malicious. Benign malware doesn’t do much besides replicate themselves and exist. They may cause the occasional problem, but it is usually an unintentional side effect. Malicious malware, on the other hand, is designed to destroy things. Once a malicious virus infects your machine, you can usually kiss the contents of your hard drive goodbye.
Good anti-virus software is your first line of defense against malware. Be aware of the following when using anti-virus software:
•	Virus definition files are provided by the software vendor. These files are used to identify viruses and are a vital component of the anti-virus software. 
•	Protection against a virus is only provided after a definition file has been released which matches the target virus. 
•	For maximum protection, you must keep the definition files updated. Most software will automatically check for updated definition files daily. 
•	Most anti-virus software includes spyware and adware protection. 
•	You should scan new files before they are copied or downloaded to the system. You should also periodically scan the entire system. 
Additional countermeasures for malware include:
•	Install anti-virus scanning software on e-mail servers. Attachments are scanned before e-mail is delivered. You can also block all attachments to prevent any unwanted software, but this can also block needed attachments as well. 
•	Implement spam filters and real-time blacklists. When implementing filters, be sure not to make the filters too broad, otherwise legitimate e-mails will be rejected. 
•	Train users to use caution when downloading software or responding to e-mail. 
•	Train users to update the virus definition files frequently and to scan removable storage devices before copying files.
•	Disable scripts when previewing or viewing e-mail. 
•	Implement software policies that prevent downloading software from the Internet. 
•	Keep your operating system files up to date; apply security-related hotfixes as they are released.

# Computer Crimes History
The following historical events have had a tremendous impact on Computer Security and their method of intrusion into Information Systems:
The Worm - Perhaps the most famous computer worm, dubbed "Attack of the Giant Worm" is the one that was unleashed upon the Internet on Nov. 2, 1988. Computers across the country were infected, from universities and military bases to research establishments.
This worm moved across network lines from computer to computer. Once installed, it multiplied, creating processes and rapidly clogging the computer's drivespace, until the computer stopped functioning. It collected user data and network information and exploited a number of UNIX security holes. It also carried a dictionary of commonly used passwords and took advantage of the "trusted host" system of UNIX network communication.
Estimates of computers affected ranged upwards of 6,000 initially, but upon final analysis the number was in the 2,100-2,600 range. Although it infected a great number of computers, little damage was done. It never destroyed data, just bogged it down.
Although no data was destroyed, a lot of system and administrative time had to be spent shutting down machines and network gateways, losing E-mail, research time, etc. Actual estimates of the cost of system fixes and testing range from 1-100 million Dollars.
The culprit was Robert T. Morris, a Cornell University graduate student. He claimed the worm was an experimental program containing a bug that caused it to run rampant.
On Jan 23, 1990, Morris was the first person convicted by a federal grand jury under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. He faced up to 5 years in jail, a $250,000 fine, and restitution for damages. He actually received a 3-year probation and ordered to pay a $10,000 fine, 400 hours of community service, and pay an additional $91 per month for supervision during probation.
Friday the 13th - In January of 1988, a student at Hebrew University in Jerusalem em discovered that thousands of university computers were infected with a virus. The virus slowed down processing on certain Friday the l3ths and was scheduled to erase the hard disks of financial, research, and administrative computers on May 13, 1988.
Since this resilient virus first reared its ugly head, it appears to have popped up at many different times in different spots around the world.
Virus Flambé - In 1988, a virus infecting a firm of computer consultants in San Jose, California did more than damage data - it damaged equipment as well. The virus altered the scan rate of an IBM monitor's electronic beam, and the monitor burst into flames.
Rome Labs - In attacks against Rome Lab information systems in upstate New York, 1 16- year old British hacker penetrated several federal-interest computer systems, transferring data from Goddard Space Flight Center and compromising software application packages. The hacker gained access to artificial intelligence software dealing with air order of battle, captured 4 megabytes, and then hid those on another information system at a commercial Internet provider.
It was extremely difficult to detect and identify him, because he only intruded on average for two to three minutes at a time. Not until Scotland Yard monitored his phone lines and traced his intrusions back did they discover his Internet routes through South America and his mimicking of more advanced hacker there. Copying their techniques, he eventually discovered clever means to attack other US targets.
Over 150 separate attacks caused over $500,000 in damages at Rome Labs, not including investigative costs, and denied service to 1,000~users for one to three weeks.
Hanover Hacker - In 1986, a German man living in Hanover, armed only with a personal computer, managed to exploit the then-existent computer networks, patching through the German telephone system to a defense contractor's computer system on the east coast of the US, using either satellite or Trans-Atlantic cable linkage. From this defense contractor's system in Mclean VA, and using their accounts to pay for phone calls, connected to the Lawrence Berkeley Lab. There, he then used their networking system to find and exploit defense contractors and defense facilities... collecting information, reading files, even inserting his own programs, all of which allowed him very high-level access to everything in those systems. He gained privileges to copy, modify, write, or destroy any data in the system. Not only did he manage to travel electronically all over the US, but also he managed to connect to the far Pacific using the same systems, collecting information of all kinds from the Ft. Buckner Okinawa defense facility.

# Malware Packages
## Adware
Adware monitors actions that denote personal preferences, then sends pop-ups and ads that match those preferences. Adware: 
•	Is usually passive. 
•	Is privacy invasive software. 
•	Is installed on your machine by visiting a particular Web site or running an application. 
•	Is usually more annoying than harmful.

## Bomb
A bomb is a type of Trojan Horse, used to release a virus, a worm, or some other system attack. It is either an independent program or a piece of code that's been planted by someone. A bomb works by triggering some kind of unauthorized action when a particular date, time, or condition occurs.
There are two types of bombs, Time and Logic. A bomb that has been set to go off at a specific date or after some period of time has elapsed is called a Time bomb. The Friday the 13th Virus, which started doing damage on the first Friday the 13th of 1988, is an example of a Time bomb. A bomb that's set to go off when a particular event occurs is called a Logic bomb.
Logic Bombs
Similar to a Trojan Horse but it has a timing device that is keyed to go off on a certain day or time 
Can do damage anywhere from destroying data on the hard drive to releasing a virus 

## Grayware
Grayware is software that might offer a legitimate service, but which also includes features that you aren't aware of or features that could be used for malicious purposes. 
•	Grayware is often installed with the user's permission, but without the user fully understanding what they are adding. 
•	Some grayware installs automatically when another program is installed, or in some cases it can be installed automatically. 
•	Features included with grayware might be identified in the end user license agreement (EULA), or the features could be hidden or undocumented. The main objection to grayware is that the end user cannot easily tell what the application does or what was added with the application. 
•	Most classifications of grayware include: 
o	Adware and spyware programs 
o	Joke programs that perform annoying yet harmless actions (such as displaying messages or opening/closing the CD tray) 
o	Dialer programs that automatically dial long-distance or 900 numbers

## Rootkit
A rootkit is a stealthy type of malware. Once infected, a rootkit can be very difficult to detect and remove from a system. A rootkit is installed on the system such that it has Administrator-level access to the entire system. As a result, a rootkit can hide its files, processes, and registry keys in order to obscure itself from detection methods used by typical anti-malware software. If a rootkit is detected, it usually can't be removed from the system without completely re-installing the operating system from scratch.

## Spam
Spam is unwanted and unsolicited e-mail sent to many recipients. Spam: 
•	Can be benign as e-mails trying to sell products. 
•	Can be malicious containing phishing scams or malware as attachments. 
•	Wastes bandwidth and could fill the inbox, resulting in a denial of service condition where users can no longer receive e-mails. 

## Spoof
A Spoof is simply a generic name for a program that tricks an unsuspecting user into giving away privileges. Often, the spoof is penetrated by a Trojan Horse mechanism in which an user is tricked into inadvertently running an unauthorized program. The program then takes on the privileges of the user.

## Spyware
Spyware is software that is installed without the user's consent or knowledge, designed to intercept or take partial control over the user's interaction with the computer. Spyware: 
•	Is installed on your machine by visiting a particular Web page or running a particular application. 
•	Collects various types of personal information, such as Internet surfing habits and passwords, and sends the information back to its originating source. Cookies are text files that are stored on a computer to save information about your preferences, browser settings, and Web page preferences. Cookies are often used for legitimate purposes on e-commerce sites, but can be read or used for malicious purposes by spyware and other software. 
•	Uses tracking cookies to collect and report a user's activities. 
•	Can interfere with user control of the computer such as installing additional software, changing computer settings, and redirecting Web browser activity.

## Trap Door
A Trap door, or Back door, describes a mechanism that is normally used to subvert the normal security procedures of a system. Some trap doors are installed purposely by the system designer or programmer to allow for easy debugging and testing of the system. Individuals install other Trap Doors to allow them to continue to gain access to the system at will.

## Trojan Horse
Like its namesake, a Trojan Horse is a independent program that appears to be something attractive, but in reality performs a very unattractive action. The Trojan Horse may appear to be a game, a utility program, or any other type of program that would appeal to a user. It is a popular mechanism for disguising a virus or a worm.
When a user (or the system) executes a Trojan Horse, it may perform the desired function. However, in addition, it also performs the code hidden within. The hidden code may be a computer virus, a destructive subroutine, or code that compromises the system's security.
Appears to be a program 
Waits for an user to execute it 
Can infect other files on the system, or other computers on the network 
A Trojan horse is a malicious program that is disguised as legitimate or desirable software. A Trojan horse: 
•	Cannot replicate itself. 
•	Does not need to be attached to a host file. 
•	Often contains spying functions (such as a packet sniffer) or backdoor functions that allow a computer to be remotely controlled from the network. 
•	Often is hidden in useful software such as screen savers or games. A wrapper is a program that is used legitimately, but has a Trojan attached to it that will infiltrate whichever computer runs the wrapper software. 
•	Relies on user decisions and actions to spread. 
Examples include Back Orifice, NetBus, and Whack-a-Mole.

## Virus
The term “Viruses” has been used to describe a wide-array of computer attacks. Just about everybody has heard about viruses, but it is not clear about what they are and how they differ from worms and other threats to our operating systems.
Viruses have been around since the early l980’s. In recent years however, the development of viruses has since then grown by leaps and bounds. What separates virus from other threats to systems, is that viruses reproduce themselves. A virus is simply a code fragment that copies itself into a larger program, modifying that program. Unlike a worm, a virus executes only when its host program begins to run. It then replicates itself, infecting other programs as it reproduces, hence the name virus. It may infect memory, a floppy disk, or any other type of storage. It can be spread via the network, infected software, or by BBS linked to telephone lines. A virus is usually destructive in nature, degrading system performance and deleting or compromising data.
Viruses can modify the proxy settings for a web browser. In some situations, this blocks all Internet access for the user, and in other situations, it allows a computer to access malicious websites.
A virus is a program that attempts to damage a computer system and replicate itself to other computer systems. A virus has the following characteristics: 
•	A virus requires a replication mechanism which is a file that it uses as a host. When the host file is distributed, the virus is also distributed. Viruses typically attach to files with execution capabilities such as .doc, .exe, and .bat extensions. Many viruses are distributed via e-mail and are distributed to everyone in your address book. They can also be inadvertently downloaded from a malicious or compromised Web site.
•	The virus only replicates when an activation mechanism is triggered. For example, each time the infected file or program is executed, the virus is activated. 
The virus is programmed with an objective, which is usually to destroy, compromise, or corrupt data.

### Virus Types
**Boot Sector Virus**
Attaches itself to the boot sector of a floppy disk or an executable file; attacks boot sector, FAT table, partition table.
Copies all or part of itself onto the boot sector of your hard drive when you turn on your computer or try to run an executable file.
Can get one from an infected disk or the Internet 

**File-Infecting Virus**
Attach themselves to executable files associated with other programs 
Mostly attach to .EXE or .COM files but can infect .SYS, .DLL, and .BIN files 
When you open a program that contains a virus, the virus loads into your computer’s memory and then infects any other executed program. 

**Macro Virus**
Affect the Microsoft Word and Excel documents & templates and all documents created afterward
Once infected, every document or spreadsheet opened with the program becomes corrupted. 
Widespread 

**Meta Virus** 
The first viruses known to infect data files and work on multiple platforms 
Normally carried in data files for Microsoft Word and AmiPro documents 

**Multipartite Virus**
Can infect the boot sector and executable files 
Combine characteristics of memory-resident and nonresident files, and boot sector viruses incorporating stealth and polymorphic characteristics. 

**Polymorphic Virus**
Can infect the boot sector, files, or both 
Can modify their appearance and signature 
Use code alteration and encryption so that they can not be detected by anti-virus search screens 

**Stealth Viruses**
Infects a file by adding bytes to the infected file, and then subtracting the same number of bytes to from the directory entry of that file, so that it appears that nothing is different 
Stay in memory 

## Worm
Unlike a virus, a worm is an independent program. It reproduces by copying itself in full-blown fashion from one computer to another, usually over a network. It usually does not modify other programs, and usually does not destroy data. It is not benign, it does its damage by harnessing the resources of the network, by reproducing itself and eventually shutting down the network. Worms differ from viruses in that they are an independent program not reliant upon another program to execute itself.
Often mistaken for a virus 
A single destructive program on a single system 
Often planted by someone with direct access to the system 
A worm is a self-replicating program. A worm: 
•	Does not require a host file to propagate. 
•	Automatically replicates itself without an activation mechanism. A worm can travel across computer networks without requiring any user assistance. 
•	Infects one system and spreads to other systems on the network.

## Other Threats
**Bacteria** - Program that do nothing but make copies of themselves, but by doing this they eventually use all the resources of your system.
**Crabs** - Programs that attack the display of data on computer terminals
**Creepers** - Worm-like creatures that crawled through the ARPANET in a demonstration program in the early 1970's.
**Rabbits** - Another name for rapidly reproducing programs.
**Salamis** - Slice away (vice hack away) tiny pieces of data. For example, alters one or two numbers of a decimal point in a file, or it shaves pennies off a customer's bank interest calculations and deposits the pennies into the intruder's account.

# Malware Protection & Detection
- Spybot Search & Destroy
- AdAware (LavaSoft)
Malicious code (sometimes called malware) is a type of software designed to take over or damage a computer, without the user's knowledge or approval. Malware includes:
•	Viruses that attach to legitimate files and spread when the files are opened. 
•	Worms that infect systems and spread automatically through the network. 
•	Trojan horse programs that appear to be useful programs but which perform secret or malicious acts. 
•	Spyware that tracks your computer or browser activity. 
•	Adware that displays pop-up advertisements based on your browser activity. 
•	Spam that is unwanted, unsolicited e-mail, often carrying viruses or advertisements for questionable or illegal products. 
You should protect all systems with malware protection software to help prevent and control malware on your system. Be aware of the following when protecting against malware:
•	Most vendors have products that protect against a wide range of malware including spyware, adware, and even spam. Installing a software suite is often less expensive and easier to manage than installing separate programs for different types of threats. 
•	You can install anti-malware software on an individual host system or on a network server to scan attachments and files before they reach the end computer. 
•	Most anti-malware software that protects a single host uses a signature-based scanning system. 
o	The malware engine is the program that provides the user interface and executes the logic on the system. 
o	Signature files (also called definition files) identify specific known threats. During a system scan, the engine runs and compares files on your computer against the signature files looking for malware. 
o	Software that uses signatures can only detect threats that have been identified by an associated signature file. Malicious software that does not have a matching signature file will not be detected (and you are not protected against these files). 
o	It is important to keep the signature files up to date. If possible download new signature files daily (most software will check for updates automatically on a schedule). 
o	Keep the scanning engine software updated to add new features and fix bugs in the scanning software. 
•	Some scanning software integrates with your browser or e-mail client, and automatically scans downloaded files or incoming e-mails for threats. Many e-mail services include virus scanning before messages are forwarded to your computer or before the files are downloaded. 
•	In addition to using scanning software, keep your operating system and browser up to date. Make sure to apply security-related hotfixes as they are released. 
•	Disable scripts when previewing or viewing e-mail. 
•	Implement software policies that prevent downloading software from the Internet. 
•	Scan all files before copying them to your computer or running them. 
•	In highly-secured areas, remove removable drives (such as recordable optical drives and USB drives) to prevent unauthorized software from entering a system. 
•	Show full file extensions on all files. Viruses, worms, and Trojans often make use of double file extensions to change the qualities of files that are normally deemed harmless. For example, adding the extension .TXT.EXE to a file will make the file appear as a text file in an attachment, when in reality it is an executable. 
•	Use the Security Center in Windows Vista/7 to check the current security status of your computer. The Security Center shows you whether you have antivirus, firewall, and automatic updates running. 
•	Train users about the dangers of downloading software and the importance of anti-malware protections. Teach users to scan files before running them, and make sure they keep the virus protection definition files up to date. 
•	Network Access Control (NAC) is a network-based solution that prevents unprotected computers from connecting to the network. With NAC: 
o	Computers must meet certain health requirements before they are allowed to connect to the network. These requirements might include having the latest security patches installed, having antivirus software, or having completed a recent antivirus scan. 
o	Computers that meet the health requirements are given access to the network; computers that do not pass the health checks are denied full access. 
o	Remediation for unhealthy computers provides resources to fix the problem. For example, the computer might be given limited network access in order to download and install the required antivirus software. 
o	Network Access Protection (NAP) is Microsoft's implementation of NAC. 
If you suspect that your system is infected with malware, keep the following in mind: 
•	Common symptoms of malware on your system include: 
o	The browser home page or default search page has changed. 
o	Excessive pop-ups or strange messages being displayed. 
o	Firewall alerts about programs trying to access the Internet. 
o	System errors about corrupt or missing files. 
o	File extension associations have changed to open files with a different program. 
o	Files that disappear, are renamed, or are corrupt. 
o	New icons appear on the desktop or taskbar, or new toolbars show in the browser. 
o	The firewall or antivirus software is turned off, or you can't run antivirus scans. 
o	The system won't boot. 
•	Some malicious software can hide itself such that there might not be any obvious signs of its presence. Other symptoms of an infection include: 
o	Slow Internet access. 
o	Excessive network traffic, or traffic during times when no activity should be occurring. 
o	Excessive CPU or disk activity. 
o	Low system memory. 
o	An unusually high volume of outgoing e-mail, or e-mail sent during off hours. 
•	Conducting regular system scans can detect and fix many problems. 
o	Most software lets you schedule complete system scans, such as daily or weekly. 
o	If you suspect a problem, initiate a full system scan immediately. 
•	Remediation is the process of correcting any problems that are found. Most antivirus software remediates problems automatically or semi-automatically (i.e. you are prompted to identify the action to take). Possible actions in response to problems are: 
o	Repair the infection. Repair is possible for true viruses that have attached themselves to valid files. During the repair, the virus is removed and the file is placed back in its original state (if possible). Configuration changes made by the infection may also need to be repaired. For example, if the virus changed the default browser home page or search page, you may need to manually reset them using Internet Options in Control Panel.
o	Quarantine the file. Quarantine moves the infected file to a secure folder where it cannot be opened or run normally. You might quarantine an infected file that cannot be repaired to see if another tool or utility might be able to recover the file at another time. 
o	Delete the file. You should delete files that are malicious files such as worms, Trojan horse programs, or spyware or adware programs. In addition, you should periodically review the quarantine folder and delete any files you do not want to recover. 
•	If a scan reports a serious problem, disconnect your computer from the network. This prevents your computer from infecting other computers until the problem is corrected. 
•	Some malicious software warnings, such as those seen in pop-ups or received through e-mail, are hoax viruses. A hoax virus instructs you to take an action to protect your system, when in fact that action will cause harm. Two common hoaxes are: 
o	Instructing you to delete a file that is reported as a virus. The file is actually an important system file that will lead to instability or the inability to boot your computer. 
o	Instructing you to download and run a program to see if your system is compromised or to add protection to your system. The file you download is the malicious software. 
Before taking any actions based on notices or e-mails, search the Internet for a list of virus hoaxes and compare your notice to know hoaxes. 
Recovery from malware could include the following actions:
•	If scans detect malware, then repair, quarantine, or delete the malicious software. 
•	Some malware cannot be removed because it is running. 
o	If possible, stop the program from running, then try to remove it. 
o	If you are unable to stop the malware, try booting into Safe Mode, then run the scanning software to locate and remove the malware. 
•	If malware has caused damage to the system, it may be permanent and could require that you reinstall applications, features, restore files from a backup, or even restore the entire operating system from scratch.  
•	If malware has damaged or corrupted system files, you might be able to repair the infected files using Sfc.exe. 
o	Before running Sfc, be sure to remove the program that caused the damage (or it might re-introduce the problem after the fix). 
o	You might need to boot into the Recovery Console to check system file integrity and repair any problems found. 
•	Some malware can corrupt the boot block on the hard disk preventing the system from starting. To repair the problem, try using the Recovery Console in Windows XP, or perform an automatic repair in Windows Vista/7. Use fixmbr or fixboot in the Recovery Console to try to repair the damage. 
•	If the organization uses imaging solutions, you can quickly reimage a machine if it is infected with malware. Reimaging or installing from scratch is often faster and more effective than malware removal and cleanup.

## Virus Prevention
A virus is a program that enters a computer without the user’s knowledge. Viruses can cause serious damage by affecting programs and system components. However, you can take appropriate steps to remove a virus. A virus spreads by attaching itself to programs and boot sectors. Viruses have the ability to replicate, as well as modify programs and file structures. Viruses are usually written by people with malicious intent and can cause havoc in your system. Based on what they infect, viruses can be classified as program virus, boot virus, or multipartite virus. 
Program viruses infect executable files such as .COM, .EXE, .OVL, .DRV, .SYS and .BIN. A program virus executes whenever the infected file is executed. The Jerusalem virus infects .COM and .EXE files and is set to activate on a particular date. This virus has different strains and is also known by other names such as Black Hole and Israeli. The damage caused by the Jerusalem virus includes blanking out portions of screen, deleting program files and formatting disks. Cascade is a memory-resident virus that activates randomly. It is encrypted by using a random key and therefore, is difficult to detect. The effects of the Cascade virus include characters dropping through the displayed page and random reboots.
Boot viruses, or system viruses, infect the boot record, the master boot record, the FAT and the partition table. These viruses are loaded into the RAM whenever the boot sector is read. Brain is a boot record infector that evades detection by making a copy of the original boot record. However, it can be detected by booting with a clean boot floppy. The effects of this virus include changing the disk label and formatting the disk. The Italian virus is also known as Bouncing Ball or Ping-Pong. It affects the system by causing characters to bounce around the screen, FAT mismatches, and display Track 0 bad - disk unusable message. The New Zealand Virus damages the master boot record. It comes in various strains and is more popularly known as Stoned or Dope. The effects of this virus includes damaging hard disks and displays a "Legalize Marijuana" message during boot up.
Multipartite viruses display the characteristics of both program and boot viruses. Ghostball is a virus that infects both boot sectors and programs. 
There are viruses that affect specific files and components. Some of the common viruses in this category are Word Macro virus, Excel Macro virus, and CMOS virus.
The Word Macro family of viruses uses the WordBasic macro language to infect and replicate in and among Microsoft Word documents and templates. This virus spreads by infecting the NORMAL.DOT template. This template is used by a majority of other documents and templates on the system. Once entrenched in the NORMAL.DOT template, the virus spreads to all the other documents and templates as they are opened. A particular variant of the Word Macro virus is the Concept virus. This virus forces documents to be saved as Word templates. This enables the virus to spread because standard document files do not allow macros to be saved. The widespread use of e-mail to send Word documents as attachments causes this virus to spread very quickly.
The Excel Macro family of viruses infects Excel spreadsheets. An example of this category of virus is XM.Laroux. This virus consists of two macros called Auto_Open and Check_Files, which are stored in a hidden datasheet named Laroux. This is how the virus works. When an infected spreadsheet is first opened, the Auto_Open macro is automatically run by Excel. The Auto_Open macro in turn runs the Check_Files macro. The Check_Files macro then copies the worksheet and the virus code into a spreadsheet file named PERSONAL.XLS in the Excel startup directory. Copying the macros to the Excel startup directory infects all the spreadsheets that are opened subsequently.
The CMOS virus is a destructive memory-resident virus that infects the master boot record. While the virus is memory resident, it reduces the available free memory by 1024 bytes. The virus can also erase the CMOS setup information. This happens once in a cycle of 60 system boots.    Viruses can be classified as program, boot or multipartite. You can prevent or reduce the damage caused by a particular type of virus by taking appropriate action. 

## Virus Protection
Most viruses are little more than nuisances. However, there are viruses that can cause a lot of damage to your system. You can minimize the risk of virus infections by taking precautions. As with most infections, taking preventive measures is better than trying to clean up after the infection has occurred. The important point to remember while dealing with viruses is that viruses require a carrier to spread. The widespread use of floppy disks to transfer files between PCs makes them the primary source of virus infections. In addition, all floppy disks, including non-bootable disks, have a boot sector. As a result, floppy disks are potential carriers of boot sector viruses. The other major cause of virus infections is the use of networks to transfer files. Some common examples of network-related activities that increase the chances of a virus infection are:
•	Downloading software from the Internet
•	Sending files via E-mail
•	Sharing Files over a network 
However, it is not possible to pick up a boot sector virus from the network.
To prevent virus infections, PCs should ideally neither be connected to the network nor use floppy disks. However, this is not a practical solution. You can reduce the risk of a virus infection by taking certain precautions. The best preventive measure that you can take is to run a virus scanner on all floppy disks and on any file downloaded from a network before they are used on a system. However, this may be difficult to implement. A more workable solution is to run a virus scanner on a regular basis. The problem with virus scanners is that they work after the virus has entered the system. To prevent an infection from occurring, an anti-virus program that stays resident in the memory is your best defense. These programs stay active in the memory and notify you the moment a virus is detected. For anti-virus programs to be effective, they have to be updated regularly. This enables them to recognize the new strains of viruses that are always appearing. 
MS-DOS is shipped with two anti-virus programs MSAV and VSAFE. MSAV is a virus scanner that checks for specific viruses, while VSAFE is a Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) that constantly monitors for signs of an infection. In addition to the virus scanners that are bundled with operating systems, you can buy third-party virus scanners. SCAN32 from Network Associates is an excellent anti-virus utility for Windows 95.
In addition to using virus scanners, there are other precautions that you can take. Do not allow users to run unauthorized or pirated software on any PC. The risk of a virus infection increases when you use pirated software instead of the legal versions. While it is rare for legal software to be infected, do not assume it is virus free. Scan out-of-the-box software for viruses before it is installed. Keep all the original copies of software in a safe location. Do not use software from unknown or unreliable sources. In particular, do not let employees use software brought from their homes. Home computers are often accessed by users who are less wary of viruses. If you are using software that is downloaded from bulletin boards and the Internet, ensure that it is from reputable sites. In addition, scan the downloaded software on a test system before installing it on a production system. To reduce the risk of boot sector viruses, do not share boot diskettes between PCs. You can prevent viruses from entering a floppy disk by write-protecting it. Ensure that all boot diskettes are write-protected. In a networked environment, it is advisable to control the access to the resources that are shared. Do not allow external users uncontrolled access to your resources. 
Virus infections can lead to loss of data and time, and they can be expensive. By implementing the measures that you have learned in this topic, you can avoid the perils of a virus infection.
